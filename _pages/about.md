**I am looking for internship oppertunities for 2023 summer!**

Hi, I am Zhilin Wang, a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer and Information Science at Purdue University, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA. I got my Bachelor's degree from Nanchang University in June 2020, and I started my Ph.D. in January 2021. My research interests include Federated Learning, Edge Computing, Blockchain, Optimization Theory, and Game Theory. My supervisor is [Prof. Qin Hu](https://cs.iupui.edu/~qinhu/?_gl=1*5xczlx*_ga*MTk3MTQ5NTQ4Ni4xNjYwMzg5NDUy*_ga_61CH0D2DQW*MTY3Nzg0MTM1MS4xOS4wLjE2Nzc4NDEzNTEuMC4wLjA.). I am the reviewer of IEEE TPDS, IEEE IoTJ, Elsevier JNCA, IEEE ICC'22, IEEE Access, and Elsevier HCC, and I also serve as the TPC member for IEEE ICC'22 Workshop. 

If you have any interest in conducting research with me, please feel free to email me and we can schedule a meeting to discuss the potential opportunity.
